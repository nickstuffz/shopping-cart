Requirements:


Guidelines:
We are trusting the ID to not change at the API level

Resources:
Tailwind

Fake Store API

use React Router and loader (instead of useEffect)
 

optional in future:
Typescript
Tanstack router 

Ideas:
Jewelery category 

Fine.

Add custom scrollbar (bookmarked in Chrome)
Add that border effect? From hyperplexed (i think) youtube video


1. Create mockup in Figma
2. Export to Zeplin
3. Write first three components (Header (inside Root), Shop, Sidebar)
4. Write test for API fetching logic
5. Load data into Shop



Data is fetched on shop load and in adding a NEW product to cart.
In real app, needs to have cart count validation. Probably fetch on every reload to ensure up to date info.
Would use a query manager.
